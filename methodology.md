# Technical Methodology

## üéØ Project Overview

This project combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Machine Learning to analyze urban heat island patterns in New York City. The methodology follows established scientific practices for environmental data analysis and predictive modeling.

## üìä Data Sources and Collection

### Satellite Imagery
- **Primary Source**: Landsat 8/9 satellite imagery
- **Spatial Resolution**: 30m for most bands, 100m for thermal
- **Temporal Coverage**: 2013-present
- **Key Bands Used**:
  - Band 4 (Red): 630-680 nm
  - Band 5 (NIR): 845-885 nm  
  - Band 10 (Thermal): 10.6-11.2 Œºm

### Ground Truth Data
- **NYC Weather Stations**: Temperature measurements
- **NYC Open Data**: Building footprints, land use
- **USGS Digital Elevation Models**: Terrain data

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Satellite Data Preprocessing
```python
# Key processing steps:
1. Atmospheric correction (if needed)
2. Cloud masking and quality filtering  
3. Geometric correction and projection
4. Band calculations (NDVI, LST, etc.)
```

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **NDVI Calculation**: `(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)`
- **Land Surface Temperature**: Derived from thermal bands using established algorithms
- **Urban Features**: Building density, population metrics
- **Spatial Features**: Distance to water, elevation, neighborhood statistics

### 3. Quality Control
- Remove cloudy pixels (>20% cloud cover)
- Filter outliers using statistical methods
- Validate against ground truth measurements

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Approach

### Model Selection Rationale
We implemented multiple algorithms to compare performance:

1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for interpretability
2. **Random Forest**: Handles non-linear relationships, provides feature importance
3. **XGBoost**: State-of-the-art gradient boosting
4. **Neural Networks**: Captures complex patterns

### Feature Selection
Primary features based on literature review:
- **Vegetation Index (NDVI)**: Strong cooling effect
- **Building Density**: Heat retention factor  
- **Population Density**: Human activity heat source
- **Distance to Water**: Natural cooling effect
- **Elevation**: Affects local climate

### Model Validation
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 random split
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robust evaluation
- **Metrics**: R¬≤, RMSE, MAE for regression performance
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis for model interpretability

## üìà Urban Heat Island Intensity Calculation

UHI Intensity = LST_urban - LST_rural_reference

Where:
- LST_urban: Land surface temperature at urban location
- LST_rural_reference: 10th percentile temperature (rural proxy)

## üó∫Ô∏è Spatial Analysis Methods

### Grid-Based Analysis
- Create spatial grids (0.01¬∞ resolution)
- Calculate neighborhood statistics
- Analyze spatial autocorrelation

### Hot Spot Detection
- Identify temperature clusters using Getis-Ord Gi*
- Map significant hot and cool spots
- Correlate with urban features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Assumptions

### Data Limitations
- Satellite data limited by cloud cover
- Single point-in-time analysis vs. temporal dynamics
- 30m resolution may miss micro-scale effects

### Model Assumptions
- Linear relationships between some variables
- Stationarity of relationships across space
- Representative training data

### Validation Constraints
- Limited ground truth weather stations
- Temporal mismatch between satellite and ground data
